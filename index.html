 <p><b>Ida Bell Wells-Barnett was an American investigative journalist, educator, and early leader in the civil rights movement born on July 16, 1862 in Holly Springs,MS She died on March 25, 1931, Chicago, IL She was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Throughout the 1890s, Wells documented lynching in the United States in articles and through pamphlets such as Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in all its Phases and The Red Record, which debunked the fallacy frequently voiced by Whites at the time that all Black lynching victims were guilty of crimes. Wells exposed the brutality of lynching, and analyzed its sociology, arguing that Whites used lynching to terrorize African Americans in the South because they represented economic and political competition and thus a threat of loss of power for Whites. She aimed to demonstrate the truth about this violence and advocate for measures to stop it. </p>></b>
